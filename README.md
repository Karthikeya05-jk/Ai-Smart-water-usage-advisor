# AI-Based Smart Water Usage Advisor 

## Project Overview
Water scarcity is a growing sustainability challenge, especially in urban and semi-urban areas. This project proposes an AI-based Smart Water Usage Advisor that analyzes household water consumption patterns and provides intelligent recommendations to reduce wastage and promote sustainable water use.

## Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)
- **SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation**

## Problem Statement
Increasing water scarcity is a major sustainability challenge where households often consume water inefficiently due to lack of awareness and monitoring. Existing systems fail to provide actionable insights, leading to excessive water usage and long-term stress on water resources.

## Proposed Solution
The Smart Water Usage Advisor uses AI to analyze daily and weekly water usage data, detect inefficient consumption patterns, and generate personalized water-saving recommendations. The system helps users understand their water usage behavior and adopt sustainable practices.

## AI Technologies Used
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- IBM Granite Foundation Models
- Agentic AI
- Prompt Engineering
- Rule-Based Logic

## How the System Works
1. Water usage data is collected (manual or simulated).
2. AI analyzes consumption patterns using Granite models.
3. RAG retrieves relevant water conservation guidelines.
4. Agentic AI generates personalized recommendations.
5. Users receive actionable water-saving advice.

## Responsible AI Considerations
- Uses anonymized data only
- No personal or sensitive information collected
- Transparent and explainable recommendations
- Designed for ethical and sustainable use

## Expected Impact
- Reduction in household water wastage
- Improved awareness of sustainable water consumption
- Support for long-term water conservation efforts

## Project Type
- Conceptual Prototype with AI Workflow and Flowchart
